# Generalizability of AI-Enabled Medical Devices Approved for Clinical Use

## Overview
Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled medical devices are increasingly used, yet details about their clinical generalizability remain unclear.
We identified and analyzed key characteristics of AI-enabled medical devices approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that are relevant to their generalizability.
